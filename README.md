# Normal-and-Tension-Calculator
A Python based, Normal-and-Tension-Calculator

-- This Calculator is used to calculate Normal on the blocks and Tension in a string, when two blocks are connected together on an inclined slope
-- The eg.png has an example of the problem
-- Using Math module, Normal on each block and Tension in each string is computed
-- Coefficent of Friction and Angle of Inclination is asked by the User
